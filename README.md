## (Hello World)

I decided to stop using GitHub for anything other than private repos, open source and security when they started [using it for training Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-individual/about-github-copilot-individual#will-my-private-code-be-shared-with-other-users).

I created a blog on GitHub Pages to help educate developers on security topics in what I hope is an easy to understand form, using a blog generator I wrote in Rust. (Not open-source. Proprietary.)

You can check it out [here](https://www.example.com).  (Also please let me know if you find any misinformation that may have been hallucinated...)

Most of my code is proprietary and hosted on private repos.  Not mentioning it to be cool, more to explain why this profile is deliberately sparse.

Did you know ChatGPT cannot correct errata?  [Misinformation is baked in](https://medium.com/geekculture/why-chatgpt-lies-4d4e0c6e864e).  Use at your own risk.  It's harder to unlearn something than learn it from a proper source.

No, Python is not a functional language, [and never will be](https://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/04/origins-of-pythons-functional-features.html).  As frustrating as that is.
