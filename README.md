## (Hello World)

I decided to stop using GitHub for anything other than private repos, open source, and security when they started [using it for training Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/copilot-individual/about-github-copilot-individual#will-my-private-code-be-shared-with-other-users).

Most of my code is proprietary and hosted on private repos, but I keep a few things here publicly to showcase/share.
