I decided to stop using GitHub for anything other than open source and security when they started using it for training Copilot.

I ran 2 separate GitHub accounts for dev/security, but deleted my main account after moving the repos to a VPS.

I also run a blog on GitHub Pages to help educate developers on security topics in what I hope is an easy to understand form.
